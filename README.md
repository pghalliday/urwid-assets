# urwid-assets

## TODO

- split rates from assets to allow display of different currencies independent of data source pairs
  - apply dijkstra for shortest path between pairs
  - apply weights (cost) for less desirable conversions (eg, higher cost for less liquid pairs)
- fix move list item focus stickiness in table (scroll and not move?)
- delete assets on deletion of data source (after confirm)
- prevent add asset unless there is at least one data source
- change passphrase
- more documentation
- mouse click handling (double clicks)
- field validation in config dialogs
